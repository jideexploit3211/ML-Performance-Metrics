How to measure the Performance of ML Models
It is so necessary to Evaluate the performance of a Machine learning model while building ML model. 
Different metrics are used to evaluate the performance or quality of the model:

**1. Performance Metrics for Classification**
Accuracy,
Confusion Matrix,
Precision,
Recall,
F-Score,
AUC(Area Under the Curve)-ROC,

**2. Performance Metrics for Regression**
Mean Absolute Error,
Mean Squared Error,
R2 Score,
Adjusted R2,
